Think Java 5.12

Exercise 1:
Logical operators can simplify nested conditional statements. For example, can you rewrite this code using a single if statement?

if (x > 0 && x < 10)
  {
    System.out.println("Positive single digit number");
  }



Exercise 2:
1) Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the second time zoop is invoked.


zoop - fred ("breakfast ") bob (4)


2)What is the complete output?

just for
any not more
It's breakfast
!


Exercise 3:
Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program in Section 5.8 after main invokes nLines with the parameter n == 4, just before the last invocation of nLines returns.

public static void nLines(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        System.out.println();
        nLines(n - 1);
    }
}

main:
nLines: n 4
nLines: n 3
nLines: n 2
nLines: n 1

// nLines: n 0 is omitted because that is the last invocation of nLines
